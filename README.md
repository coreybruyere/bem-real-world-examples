# A List of Sites That Use the BEM Syntax

This is a list of sites across the web that are using the BEM syntax.
It's home to good examples of BEM (good naming, correct syntax) and not-so-good examples (bad naming, inconsistent syntax), but that's not really the point... This list is simply a reference to see how other developers are building components and websites with BEM.
