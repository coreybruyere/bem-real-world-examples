# A List of Sites That Use the BEM Syntax

Ever wonder what real-world application of the BEM syntax looks like on sites across the web?  Who am I
kidding? I know you do.

This is a list of known sites that are using the BEM syntax within the site's markup.
It's also home to good examples of BEM(good naming, correct syntax) and not-so-good examples(bad naming, inconsistent syntax).
But that's not really the point, this list is simply a reference to see how other developers are building components and websites with BEM.
Each example will have the BEM syntax style noted next to it.
