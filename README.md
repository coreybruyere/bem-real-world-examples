# A List of Sites That Use the BEM Syntax

This is a of list sites across the web that are using the BEM syntax.
It's home to good examples of BEM (good naming, correct syntax) and not-so-good examples (bad naming, inconsistent syntax).
But that's not really the point, this list is simply a reference to see how other developers are building components and websites with BEM.
Each example will have the BEM syntax style noted next to it.
